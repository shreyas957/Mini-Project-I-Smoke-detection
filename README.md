<h1>Smoke-detection backend system for mini project-I</h1>

<p>Here I have created a backend system with spring boot 
rest api to call an external api of ThingSpeak, 
to get all the values from ESP32 MQ-2 smoke sensor
The service calls the API with every 40 second fixed 
rate to update any new values of smoke detected.
